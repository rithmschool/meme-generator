![Javascript is coming](https://68.media.tumblr.com/54dcd8c143ae6d212cb7ec7063d0fd76/tumblr_inline_nxj0omcXSw1txf1cv_1280.jpg)


For this meme generator app, you'll build a clone (with fewer features) of [imgflip.com](https://imgflip.com/).  In this directory, there are 2 folders.  A client and a server.  Most of the changes will be happening in the react client, but you must understand the server in order to make ajax requests.

## Requirements

As you user, you should be able to:

* Signup or login
* See all of the recent meme's (say the last 30)
* See images that you can "meme"ify
* Save a meme by added text to it (top text and bottom text).
* Delete your own meme (and not be able to delete other users memes).

## Bonus

* Add upvoting (this will require client and server changes.  The list of meme's should be organized by number of upvotes. A user should only be able to upvote something once.
